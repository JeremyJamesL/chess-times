# Chess Times

## Find the best and worst times you play chess

https://chess-times.jezl.xyz

A simple app that uses the Chess.com API to find the times of the day you should (or shouldn't play chess).

This is just fun experimentation with Chess APIs and exploring bigger app ideas. Not a production ready app by any means. Lacks a lot of error handling.
